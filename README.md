SECURITY ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM ENHANCED WITH FACE MASK DETECCTION AND TEMPERATURE MONITORING FOR PANDEMIC TRAUMA

COVID-19 has affected the livelihood ofmillions around the world. Pass-infection of the virus between the personnel is a large threat factor. During this pandemic,itâ€™s mandatory to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the
COVID19. Biometrics and face detection are commonly used to track individual employees' attendance but face recognition methods are ineffective because wearing mask obscures a portion of the face. This biometric can be a medium for the
transmission of viruses. The proposed system implements COVID preventive measures such as mask detection and monitors body temperature. In addition, the proposed system
checks for authorized persons using RFID technology and employs fingerprint verification application via individual mobile phones for attendance purposes. The system
predominantly inspects presence of face masks, then keeps track of body temperature and ultimately controls the automatic door associated with it using RFID technology and
android app based fingerprint recognition to allow access to people with authorization.
